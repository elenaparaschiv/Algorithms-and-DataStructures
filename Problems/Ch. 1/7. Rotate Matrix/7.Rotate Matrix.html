/** Description:
Every pixel has to rotate to 90 degrees . It starts from left to right each element changind its position 3 points to the right
 i. e. e x x x       x x x e
       x x x x   >   x x x x
       x x x x       x x x x
       x x x x       x x x x


  We use a 0(N ^2) algorithm:
  There is the square outside and the square inside:
  First moving the elements in the outside square . (starting at row 0 col 0)
  and then the elements from the inside square      (starting at row 1 col 1)

  0  0  0  0
  0  i  i  0
  0  i  i  0
  0  0  0  0

  There are 3 loops needed for such rotation across the elements :

  Loop 1: A loop that starts at row 0 col 0 and rotates 90 degrees the first left top corner element to a new psition,
  Loop 2: That requires a loop 2 which will iterates 4 times so each new position occupied by the rotation has the elements that was originally there
  rotated too to a new position
  Loop 3: A loop that stays at row 0 and iterates over col 1 and then col 2 and then col 3, so that the outside square is covered
  and all the elements will be in new positions.

  When the outside square has all elements rotated , we need to enter the inner square.
  We start at row 1 col 1 and we use loop 2 that will change the the positions of 4 elements to 90 degrees.


Sketch :

 // Loop 1 (Loop of rows)
 Iterates 2 times , once for row 0 and then for row 1
for (var i = 0 ; i < 2 ; i++)

// Loop 2 (Loop of columns):
 3 elements in a row are going to change position.
           ! not 4 because there is an edge and as the rotation is 90 degrees it will occupy 3 positions in front
            of the starting position.
 for (var i = 0 ; i < 3; i ++)

Observation L :Loop 2 has to be inside loop 1 so that the outer square is finished first
             // then loop 1 has to enter in row 1 and col 1


// Loop 3 (Loop of pixels) :
 The element starting from loop 1 will rotate.
 Since there are 4 square lines, we need to iterate 4 times.
 for (var i = 0 ; i < 4; i ++)
